# crypto-app
This is the repository for my portfolio's crypto-coin app:
* UI written in React
* Handles state changes with Redux
* Uses `axios` to query and handle data
* Displays data using [chartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/)

It showcases my understanding of web API requests, data manipulation, user interaction and component-reactivity, and how to handle the state of a complex app.
